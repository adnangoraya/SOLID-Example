## SOLID Violation Vs Implementation

This solution contains two versions of the same example:
one <b>without SOLID principles</b> applied, and another <b>with a proper SOLID-based</b> implementation. This solution contains two versions of the same example:
one without SOLID principles applied, and another with a proper SOLID-based implementation.

In the <b>Exercise</b> folder, you’ll find an example that deliberately demonstrates <b>violations of SOLID principles</b>. Please refer to the `Notes.md` file inside the Exercise folder for a detailed explanation of the issues and design problems.

At the root of the solution, you’ll find a <b>refactored implementation</b> of the same exercise that <b>fully applies all SOLID principles</b>. This version also clearly separates <b>models, services, and interfaces</b> into their appropriate application layers, following clean architecture practices.

Note: There is <b>no direct linkage</b> between the project in the Exercise folder and the SOLID implementation at the root. They are intentionally kept separate for clarity and comparison purposes.
