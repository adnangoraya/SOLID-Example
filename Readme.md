## SOLID Violation Vs Implementation

In this solution, You'll find an example without SOLID prinicples implemented and a version of same example with SOILD implementation.

* Firstly, In Excercise folder, we have an example of voilations of SOLID principles. Please read Notes.md in the Excercise folder for better understanding.
* Then, there is an implementation of that excerise which implements all SOLID principles. The implementation also splits Models, Services and interfaces etc into correct application layer.
* [Note] There is no link between the project resides in Excercise folder and the implementation on the root.
